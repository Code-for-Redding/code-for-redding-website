## Code for Redding
This is the main repository for the Code for Redding website. While I'd love to open source the code that comes with the site itself, I pay for a licence for [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) and would be in violation publishing the source code for the repository. 

Authorized individuals will be given access to the repository on the basis of trust as I risk the revocation of my license to the UI library should a developer publish the code for the public.

## Reporting an issue
If you've found an issue, please report it and I'll implement a fix as soon as possible. I want to thank all those involved in the project and hope for the continuation of our community!
